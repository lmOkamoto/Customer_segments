# Customer segments
In this project, I am going to explore the [Wholesale customer](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The dataset contains data on various customers' annual spending in monetary units on diverse product categories. 

The goal of this project is to describe the variation in the different types of customers that this wholesale distributor interacts with. To do so, I will use an unsupervised machine learning clustering model to make the customer segmentation.
